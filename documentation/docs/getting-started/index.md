# Getting started

Fusion.js is an open source web application framework for building high quality universal React/Redux/Node applications. It's meant for both small and large scale web applications. Because many Fusion.js applications are served on a large scale in countries with slow mobile networks, performance is a big driving factor for Fusion.js.

Fusion.js has a modular architecture to promote small bundle sizes, and is designed in such a way that performance milestones in its development pipeline can be rolled out to consumers via version bumps, as opposed to requiring big migrations or entirely offloading that work to app developers.

Here are the features you'll find in Fusion.js:

* server side rendering and async rendering
* ES2017 and JSX support out of the box
* hot module reloading in development mode
* bundle splitting
* universal rendering (run the same code in the server and the browser)
* server-side development via Koa.js
* plugin-based architecture (so you only include what you need in your browser bundles)
* a curated set of plugins for data fetching, styling, etc maintained by the Fusion.js team
* plugins for error logging, security, etc.
* bundle analysis tooling

If you want to know how Fusion.js compares to similar projects, see the [framework comparison page](framework-comparison.md).

### Hello world

To create a new Fusion.js application we recommend using [yarn create](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/). In a terminal, run the following:

```
yarn create fusion-app my-fusion-app
```

Fusion expects the entry file to be at `src/main.js`. There we can specify what rendering library we want to use. For convenience, the `fusion-react` package provides an entry-point application class that is already configured to work with React. Let's use that:

```js
// src/main.js
import App from 'fusion-react';
```

The `App` class constructor takes a React element. This is the root element of the application:

```js
new App(<div>Hello world</div>);
```

Now that we've configured our application, we just need to export a function that returns it:

```js
// src/main.js
import App from 'fusion-react';
import React from 'react';

export default () => {
  return new App(<div>Hello world</div>);
};
```

To run the application, run this command from your CLI:

```sh
yarn run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and will render `Hello world`.

Try changing the text to see hot reloading in action.

While the Fusion.js CLI takes care of developer productivity concerns such as Babel configuration, build-time orchestration and hot module reloading, the Fusion.js runtime does very little. This ensures that the baseline build of a Fusion.js app is lean and flexible.

However, apps can gain more functionality via plugins. In the next section, we'll look at how to use a plugin.

### Styling

Let's install these packages:

```sh
yarn add fusion-plugin-styletron-react styletron
```

This package contains the plugin for Styletron, which, in addition to providing an easy-to-use styled-component-like interface, provides [powerful server-side CSS optimizations](https://ryantsao.com/blog/virtual-css-with-styletron), yielding less CSS code down the wire.

To register the plugin, let's modify `src/main.js` to register the Styletron plugin:

```js
// src/main.js
import App from 'fusion-react';
import Styletron from 'fusion-plugin-styletron-react';
import React from 'react';

export default () => {
  const app = new App(<div>Hello world</div>);

  app.register(Styletron);

  return app;
};
```

Now, let's move our `<div>` element to a separate file called `src/components/root.js` and replace the div with a styled one:

```js
// src/components/root.js
import React from 'react';
import {styled} from 'fusion-plugin-styletron-react';

const Panel = styled('div', {background: 'silver'});

export default <Panel>Hello</Panel>;

// src/main.js
import App from 'fusion-react';
import Styletron from 'fusion-plugin-styletron-react';

import root from './components/root';

export default () => {
  const app = new App(root);

  app.register(Styletron);

  return app;
}
```

The application in your browser should automatically reload to display the silver background.

### Font loading

Fonts can be loaded via the `fusion-plugin-font-loader-react` plugin:

```js
// src/main.js
import App from 'fusion-react';
import Fonts, {
  FontLoaderReactConfigToken,
} from 'fusion-plugin-font-loader-react';
import {assetUrl} from 'fusion-core';
import root from './components/root';

export default () => {
  const app = new App(root);

  app.register(Fonts);
  app.register(FontLoaderReactConfigToken, {
    preloadDepth: 1,
    fonts: {
      'Lato-Regular': {
        urls: {
          woff: assetUrl('../static/Lato-Regular.woff'),
          woff2: assetUrl('../static/Lato-Regular.woff2'),
        },
        fallback: {
          name: 'Helvetica',
        },
      },
    },
  });

  return app;
};
```

### Assets

Use the virtual module `assetUrl` for other asset types, such as images.

```js
// src/components/root.js
import React from 'react';
import {styled} from 'fusion-plugin-styletron-react';
import {assetUrl} from 'fusion-core';

const Panel = styled('div', {background: 'silver'});

export default (
  <Panel>
    <img src={assetUrl('../../static/image.gif')} />
  </Panel>
);
```

Note that the argument to `assetUrl` needs to be a compile-time static string literal.

### Example applications

We have a list of Fusion.js example applications at on the [getting started page](https://fusionjs.com/docs/getting-started/create-a-project/#example-fusionjs-projects). There you can also find CLI tools to generate new Fusion.js applications and plugins.
